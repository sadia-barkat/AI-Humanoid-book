## Prompt

sp.task Module 1

## Response snapshot

The task list for Module 1 was created at `specs/001-module-1-ros2/tasks.md`. The tasks are broken down by user story and include setup, implementation, testing, and polish phases.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed, actionable task list for creating Module 1 of the robotics book is now available, enabling parallel work on the different user stories.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-module-1-ros2/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now start implementing the tasks in the `tasks.md` file by running `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task breakdown directly from the user stories in the `spec.md` ensures a clear link between requirements and implementation steps.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
