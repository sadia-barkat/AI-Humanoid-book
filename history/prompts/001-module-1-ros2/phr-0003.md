## Prompt

sp.plan Create:- Docusaurus book outline (sections + chapters)- Module 1 structure (ROS 2, rclpy bridge, URDF)- Research and writing workflow- Quality checks for accuracy and reproducibilityDecisions:- Docusaurus layout choices- Code example formatting- Required technical depth- Use of diagramsTesting:- ROS 2 code runs correctly- Docusaurus builds/deploys- Content clarity + correctness- RAG chatbot indexing compatibilityApproach:- Research while writing- Follow Constitution standards- Phases: Research → Outline → Draft → Validate

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for Module 1 was created at `specs/001-module-1-ros2/plan.md`. The plan outlines the creation of the Docusaurus book structure and the content for Module 1, covering core ROS 2 concepts, `rclpy` bridge, and URDF. The plan aligns with the project constitution and details the technical context, project structure, and testing strategy.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A comprehensive plan for creating Module 1 of the robotics book is now in place, guiding the next steps of research and content creation.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-module-1-ros2/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.tasks` to break down the plan into actionable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan successfully incorporates the user's requirements and the project's constitution, providing a clear roadmap for development.
