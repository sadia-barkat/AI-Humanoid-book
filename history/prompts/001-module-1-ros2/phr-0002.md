## Prompt

sp.specify Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)Focus:- Core ROS 2 concepts for humanoid control- Connecting  AI agents to robot middleware- Basics of URDF for humanoid structureChapters:Chapter 1: ROS 2 Basics  - Nodes, Topics, Services,  Actions  - How humanoid robots use ROS 2 for communication  Chapter 2: AI-to-ROS Bridge (rclpy)  - Python agent → ROS 2 command flow  - Minimal publish/subscribe examples  Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids  - Defining links, joints, sensors  - How URDF supports  simulation and control  Success Criteria:- Accurate, runnable examples  - Clear, short explanations  - Prepares reader for simulation  modules

## Response snapshot

The specification for Module 1 was created at `specs/001-module-1-ros2/spec.md`. The spec includes user stories for understanding ROS 2 basics, bridging AI to ROS, and defining a humanoid structure with URDF. It also includes functional requirements, key entities, and measurable success criteria. A quality checklist was created and passed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed specification for the first module of the robotics book was created, providing a solid foundation for the planning and implementation phases.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-module-1-ros2/spec.md` and `specs/001-module-1-ros2/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.plan` to create a plan for implementing this module.
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual workaround for the failing `create-new-feature.ps1` script was successful. This indicates a potential issue with how the agent environment handles shell command arguments with complex strings.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed to parse the feature description argument correctly.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate how to properly escape complex multi-line strings when calling PowerShell scripts from the agent's environment.
