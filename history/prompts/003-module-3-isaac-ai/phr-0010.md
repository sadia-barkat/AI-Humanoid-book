## Prompt

sp.specify Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)Focus:- Advanced perception, VSLAM, and navigation- Isaac Sim + Isaac ROS integrationChapters:1. Isaac Sim Basics   - Photorealistic scenes   - Synthetic vision data2. Isaac ROS & VSLAM   - Accelerated SLAM pipeline   - Localization + mapping3. Nav2 Navigation   - Path planning for bipedal robots   - Executing movement in dynamic spacesSuccess Criteria:- Clear, minimal, accurate explanations- Aligns with real Isaac/ROS workflows

## Response snapshot

The specification for Module 3 was created at `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/spec.md`. The spec includes user stories for exploring Isaac Sim for photorealistic scenes, implementing VSLAM with Isaac ROS, and navigating dynamic spaces with Nav2. It also includes functional requirements, key entities, and measurable success criteria. A quality checklist was created and passed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed specification for the third module of the robotics book was created, focusing on advanced AI integration with robotics using NVIDIA Isaac platform.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/spec.md` and `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.plan` to create a plan for implementing this module.
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual workaround for the failing `create-new-feature.ps1` script continues to be a necessary step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script is still not usable due to argument parsing issues.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
