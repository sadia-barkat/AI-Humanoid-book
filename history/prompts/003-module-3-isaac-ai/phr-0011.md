## Prompt

sp.plan Create:- Module 3 outline (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nav2)- Section structure for perception + navigation- Research notes and brief architecture sketch- Quality checks for accuracy and reproducibilityDecisions:- Level of detail for Isaac workflows- How many code snippets vs conceptual diagrams- Placement of perception vs navigation sections- Docusaurus page layoutTesting:- Validate steps match real Isaac/ROS behavior- Confirm Docusaurus builds cleanly- Check clarity and grounding in official sourcesApproach:- Research while writing- Follow Constitution standards- Phases: Research → Outline → Draft → Validate

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for Module 3 was created at `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/plan.md`. The plan outlines the creation of content for Module 3, focusing on advanced perception, VSLAM, and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. It details the technical context, project structure, research approach, and testing strategy, aligning with the project's constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A comprehensive plan for creating Module 3 of the robotics book is now in place, guiding the next steps of research and content creation for AI-robot integration.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.tasks` to break down the plan into actionable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan successfully integrates the user's specific requirements for Module 3 within the established planning template, considering both content and technical aspects of advanced AI robotics.
