## Prompt

sp.implement for Module 3

## Response snapshot

The implementation for Module 3 was completed according to the tasks defined in `specs/003-module-3-isaac-ai/tasks.md`. This included creating the directory structure, updating the Docusaurus sidebar, writing content for three chapters, and creating associated Isaac Sim scenes and scripts, Isaac ROS launch files and test scripts, and Nav2 configuration files. Placeholder test scripts were also created for each example, which are expected to require a full Isaac Sim/ROS environment to pass. The Docusaurus build process was run successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 3 of the robotics book now has its content outlined, Isaac Sim/ROS assets implemented, and the Docusaurus structure updated.
- 🧪 Tests: Placeholder tests were created and are expected to fail until a full Isaac Sim/ROS environment is configured. The Docusaurus build passed.
- 📁 Files: Numerous files were created and modified, including Docusaurus content, Isaac Sim assets, Isaac ROS packages, Nav2 configurations, and the `tasks.md` itself.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with further testing, setting up an Isaac Sim/ROS environment to run the examples, and eventually creating a pull request.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully navigated the implementation phase for a complex Isaac-based module, creating all required files and updating existing ones. The manual `mkdir` and `cp` commands were necessary due to PowerShell alias issues.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `mkdir -p` command with multiple arguments failed in PowerShell due to alias behavior.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Docusaurus build: PASS. Placeholder Isaac tests: Expected FAIL.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review PowerShell command execution within the agent to better handle shell-specific alias behaviors and complex argument passing.
