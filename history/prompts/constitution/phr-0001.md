## Prompt

The user repeatedly invoked the `sp.constitution` command. The initial command was to set up the project constitution.

## Response snapshot

The project constitution was created/updated, templates were aligned to the constitution's principles, and a sync impact report detailing the changes was generated. The `tasks-template.md` and `sp.tasks.md` were updated to enforce mandatory testing, and `sp.plan.md` was generalized to remove agent-specific references.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully established the project's foundational constitution and ensured consistency across key development templates.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`, `.claude/commands/sp.plan.md`, and `.claude/commands/sp.tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can proceed with other specification/planning commands, or further refine the constitution.
- 🧠 Reflection: Ensured all relevant template files were checked and updated to reflect the new constitution's principles, particularly the mandatory testing rule.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PHR script execution failed on Windows (bash script not compatible).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate cross-platform execution for PHR script or provide a PowerShell equivalent.
