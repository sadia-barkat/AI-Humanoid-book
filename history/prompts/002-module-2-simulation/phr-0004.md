## Prompt

sp.specify Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)Focus:- Physics-accurate humanoid simulation- Environment creation for testing robot behavior- Sensor simulation for perception pipelinesChapters:1. Physics Simulation in Gazebo   - Gravity, collisions, joints, and constraints   - Setting up a humanoid model for stable simulation2. High-Fidelity Interaction in Unity   - Rendering humanoid motion and environments   - Basic human-robot interaction scenes3. Simulated Sensors for Humanoids   - LiDAR, depth camera, and IMU simulation   - Feeding sensor data into the robotics pipelineSuccess Criteria:- Steps are reproducible in Gazebo + Unity- Examples are minimal, clear, and technically correct- Prepares readers for Module 3 (Isaac + advanced perception)

## Response snapshot

The specification for Module 2 was created at `specs/002-module-2-simulation/spec.md`. The spec includes user stories for simulating humanoid physics in Gazebo, creating high-fidelity interactions in Unity, and simulating robot sensors. It also includes functional requirements, key entities, and measurable success criteria. A quality checklist was created and passed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed specification for the second module of the robotics book was created, focusing on simulation environments.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/002-module-2-simulation/spec.md` and `specs/002-module-2-simulation/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.plan` to create a plan for implementing this module.
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual workaround for the failing `create-new-feature.ps1` script continues to be a necessary step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script is still not usable due to argument parsing issues.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
