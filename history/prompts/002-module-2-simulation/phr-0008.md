## Prompt

sp.task for module 2

## Response snapshot

The task list for Module 2 was created at `specs/002-module-2-simulation/tasks.md`. The tasks are broken down by user story and include setup, implementation, testing, and polish phases, covering Gazebo physics, Unity interaction, and simulated sensors.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed, actionable task list for creating Module 2 of the robotics book is now available, enabling organized development of simulation examples and content.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/002-module-2-simulation/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now start implementing the tasks in the `tasks.md` file by running `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task breakdown directly from the user stories and plan ensures alignment between requirements, design, and implementation steps for a complex simulation module.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
