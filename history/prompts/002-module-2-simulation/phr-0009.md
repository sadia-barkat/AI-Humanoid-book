## Prompt

sp.implement for module 2

## Response snapshot

The implementation for Module 2 was completed according to the tasks defined in `specs/002-module-2-simulation/tasks.md`. This included creating the directory structure, updating the Docusaurus sidebar, writing content for three chapters, and creating associated simulation and ROS 2 assets (Gazebo URDF, world file, Unity project structure and placeholder scene, placeholder ROS 2 sensor integration package). Placeholder test scripts were also created for each example, which are expected to require a full simulation environment (Gazebo/Unity/ROS 2) to pass. The Docusaurus build process was run successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 2 of the robotics book now has its content outlined, simulation assets implemented, and the Docusaurus structure updated.
- 🧪 Tests: Placeholder tests were created and are expected to fail until a full simulation environment is configured. The Docusaurus build passed.
- 📁 Files: Numerous files were created and modified, including Docusaurus content, Gazebo models/worlds, Unity project structure, ROS 2 packages, and the `tasks.md` itself.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with further testing, setting up a Gazebo/Unity/ROS 2 environment to run the examples, and eventually creating a pull request.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully navigated the implementation phase for a complex simulation module, creating all required files and updating existing ones. The manual `mkdir` and `cp` commands were necessary due to PowerShell alias issues.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `mkdir -p` command with multiple arguments failed in PowerShell due to alias behavior.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Docusaurus build: PASS. Placeholder simulation tests: Expected FAIL.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review PowerShell command execution within the agent to better handle shell-specific alias behaviors and complex argument passing.
