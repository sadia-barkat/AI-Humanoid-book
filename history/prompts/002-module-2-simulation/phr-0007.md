## Prompt

sp.plan Project: Complete Module 2 (Gazebo & Unity) using Docusaurus.Create:1.  **Architecture Sketch (M2)**: File paths for Docusaurus content and simulation assets (Gazebo/Unity scenes/code).2.  **Section Structure**: Finalize three Chapters (Gazebo Physics, Unity Interaction, Simulated Sensors).3.  **Research Approach**: Research-concurrent drafting; APA citation (from Constitution). Focus on Gazebo/Unity integration methods.4.  **Quality Validation**: Focus on **reproducible steps** across both platforms, minimal/clear examples, and readiness for **Module 3**.Decisions needing documentation:* List choices on Gazebo/Unity bridging middleware and supported platform versions.Testing strategy:* Verify **Gazebo/Unity scenes** run and **sensor data** is generated correctly. Validate **reproducible steps**.Organize by phases:1.  Research2.  Foundation3.  Analysis4.  Synthesis

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for Module 2 was created at `specs/002-module-2-simulation/plan.md`. The plan outlines the creation of content for Module 2, focusing on physics-accurate humanoid simulation in Gazebo, high-fidelity interaction in Unity, and sensor simulation. It details the technical context, project structure, research approach, and testing strategy, aligning with the project's constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A comprehensive plan for creating Module 2 of the robotics book is now in place, guiding the next steps of research and content creation for simulation environments.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/002-module-2-simulation/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can proceed with `/sp.tasks` to break down the plan into actionable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan successfully integrates the user's specific requirements for Module 2 within the established planning template, considering both content and technical aspects of simulation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
