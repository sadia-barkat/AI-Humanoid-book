# src/module-3/isaac_sim/scenes/simple_photorealistic_scene.usd
# This is a placeholder for a Universal Scene Description (USD) file.
# Creating a fully functional USD scene requires the Isaac Sim editor or advanced scripting.
#
# A typical USD scene for Isaac Sim would define:
# - A stage with a default prim.
# - Environment settings (lights, ground plane).
# - A robot model (e.g., our humanoid URDF imported and converted to USD).
# - Other static or dynamic objects (cubes, spheres, props).
# - Cameras and their properties for synthetic data generation.
#
# Example (conceptual, not runnable as raw text):
#
# #usda 1.0
# def Xform "World"
# {
#     def Scope "Looks"
#     {
#     }
#
#     def Scope "Props"
#     {
#         def "GroundPlane" (
#             references = @/World/Isaac/Environments/Simple_Room.usd@
#         )
#         {
#         }
#     }
#
#     def Xform "Robot" (
#         references = @/World/Isaac/Robots/Humanoid.usd@
#     )
#     {
#         matrix4d xformOp:transform = ( (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,0.5,1) )
#         uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:transform"]
#     }
#
#     def Camera "Camera"
#     {
#         float2 focalLength = 24
#         float2 horizontalAperture = 20.955
#         float2 verticalAperture = 15.2908
#         token projection = "perspective"
#         matrix4d xformOp:transform = ( (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), (2,0,1,1) )
#         uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:transform"]
#     }
# }
#
# To complete this task, you would typically:
# 1. Launch Isaac Sim.
# 2. Create a new stage (File -> New).
# 3. Add a ground plane and lights.
# 4. Import the humanoid robot model (e.g., from URDF using Isaac Sim's URDF Importer).
# 5. Add a camera sensor and configure its output for RGB and Depth.
# 6. Save the stage as `simple_photorealistic_scene.usd` in this directory.
